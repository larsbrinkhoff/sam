Systems Concepts Digital Synthesizer (Samson Box) emulator

Software emulator for Pete Samson's hardware synthesizer used during the late 1970's through 80's at the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, Stanford University.
The emulator code was written by William Schottstaedt, with help from Michael McNabb.

The emulator accepts binary input command files from the era, (possibly along with audio files for processing), and generates a 4-channel file of 32-bit floating point samples.

A sample input file, gender.sam, is included.
